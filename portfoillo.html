            <h2 class="background"> <strong>My background</strong> </h2>
            <p>My name is nick and i was born a little country called Haiti. Hatit is located near Dominican Republic and Cuba.
                When i was living in Haiti my family had their own farm. we had goats,chicken,cows and lamb. We were in privilage 
                postion because not many people in Haiti have their own farm  let alone a house. I have 1 brother and 2 sisters, we
                grew up very close untill we all move to the United states seperaltly. I moved to United States when i was four years old 
                in my aunt house, found more brother and sisters. Ever since that day i been living in Florida all my life.
